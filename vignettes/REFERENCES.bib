	abstract = {A core collection is a subset of a large germplasm collection that contains accessions chosen to represent the genetic variability of the germplasm collection. The purpose of the core collection is to improve management and use of a germplasm collection. Core collections are usually assembled by grouping accessions and selecting from within these groups. The objective of this study was to compare 11 methods of assembling a core collection of the U.S. National collection of annual Medicago species. These methods differed in their use of passport and evaluation data as well as their selection strategy. Another objective was to compare core collections with sample sizes of 5\%, 10\% and 17\% of the germplasm collection. Core collections assembled with evaluation data and cluster analysis better represented the germplasm collection than core collections assembled based solely on passport data and random selection of accessions, The Relative Diversity and the logarithm methods generated better core collections than the proportional method. The 5\% and 10\% sample size core collection were judged insufficient to represent the germplasm collection.},

Many statistical tools exist for analyzing their structure but, surprisingly, there are few techniques for exploratory visual display, and for depicting the patterns of relations among variables in such matrices directly, particularly when the number of variables is moderately large. This article describes a set of techniques we subsume under the name “corrgram,” based on two main schemes: (a) Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude. We consider some of the properties of several iconic representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b) Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that "similar" variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for conditional independence and partial independence is described and illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these methods.},

	abstract = {Definition of clear criteria for evaluation of the quality of core collections is a prerequisite for selecting high-quality cores. However, a critical examination of the different methods used in literature, for evaluating the quality of core collections, shows that there are no clear guidelines on the choices of quality evaluation criteria and as a result, inappropriate analyses are sometimes made leading to false conclusions being drawn regarding the quality of core collections and the methods to select such core collections. The choice of criteria for evaluating core collections appears to be based mainly on the fact that those criteria have been used in earlier publications rather than on the actual objectives of the core collection. In this study, we provide insight into different criteria used for evaluating core collections. We also discussed different types of core collections and related each type of core collection to their respective evaluation criteria. Two new criteria based on genetic distance are introduced. The consequences of the different evaluation criteria are illustrated using simulated and experimental data. We strongly recommend the use of the distance-based criteria since they not only allow the simultaneous evaluation of all variables describing the accessions, but they also provide intuitive and interpretable criteria, as compared with the univariate criteria generally used for the evaluation of core collections. Our findings will provide genebank curators and researchers with possibilities to make informed choices when creating, comparing and using core collections.},

Mahalanobis distance, calculated based on the genotypic values, is then applied to measure the genetic distance among accessions. The unweighted pair-group average, Ward’s and the complete linkage methods of hierarchical clustering combined with three sampling strategies are proposed to construct core collections in a procedure of stepwise clustering. A homogeneous test and t-tests are suggested for use in testing variances and means, respectively. The coincidence rate (CR\%) for range and the variable rate (VR\%) for the coefficient of variation are designed to evaluate the property of core collections. A worked example of constructing core collections in cotton with 21 traits was conducted. Random sampling can represent the genetic diversity structure of the initial collection. Preferred sampling can keep the accessions with special or valuable characteristics in the initial collection. Deviation sampling can retain the larger genetic variability of the initial collection. For better representation of the core collection, cluster methods should be combined with different sampling strategies. The core collections based on genotypic values retained larger genetic variability and had superior representatives than those based on phenotypic values.},

	abstract = {A general coefficient measuring the similarity between two sampling units is defined. The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},
