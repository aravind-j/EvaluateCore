  ABSTRACT = {A core collection is a subsample of a larger germ plasm collection that contains, with a minimum of repetitiveness, the maximum possible genetic diversity of the species in question (Frankel 1984; Frankel and Brown 1984). Brown (1989a) argued that before creating the core collection, the larger collection should first be hierarchically stratified into groups of accessions that share common characters or that originate from similar ecological and geographic regions. Such a stratification could be based on passport data, knowledge of the structure of the gene pool, or both. Accessions are then drawn from each group. Several sampling strategies are used to determine how to allocate sampling effort across groups (Brown 1989b). In the absence of detailed genetic data about the individuals within the groups, all groups can be represented evenly, or in proportion to their group size, or in proportion to the logarithm of their group size (refereed as the C−, P−, and L− strategies, respectively) (Brown 1989b).},

  ABSTRACT = {Core collections provide genebank curators and plant breeders a way to reduce size of their collections and populations, while minimizing impact on genetic diversity and allele frequency. Many methods have been proposed to generate core collections, often using distance metrics to quantify the similarity of two accessions, based on genetic marker data or phenotypic traits. Core Hunter is a multi-purpose core subset selection tool that uses local search algorithms to generate subsets relying on one or more metrics, including several distance metrics and allelic richness.},

  ABSTRACT = {Sampling core subsets from genetic resources while maintaining as much as possible the genetic diversity of the original collection is an important but computationally complex task for gene bank managers. The Core Hunter computer program was developed as a tool to generate such subsets based on multiple genetic measures, including both distance measures and allelic diversity indices. At first we investigate the effect of minimum (instead of the default mean) distance measures on the performance of Core Hunter. Secondly, we try to gain more insight into the performance of the original Core Hunter search algorithm through comparison with several other heuristics working with several realistic datasets of varying size and allelic composition. Finally, we propose a new algorithm (Mixed Replica search) for Core Hunter II with the aim of improving the diversity of the constructed core sets and their corresponding generation times.},

  ABSTRACT = {Motivation: Core sets are necessary to ensure that access to useful alleles or characteristics retained in genebanks is guaranteed. We have successfully developed a computational tool named ‘PowerCore’ that aims to support the development of core sets by reducing the redundancy of useful alleles and thus enhancing their richness.Results: The program, using a new approach completely different from any other previous methodologies, selects entries of core sets by the advanced M (maximization) strategy implemented through a modified heuristic algorithm. The developed core set has been validated to retain all characteristics for qualitative traits and all classes for quantitative ones. PowerCore effectively selected the accessions with higher diversity representing the entire coverage of variables and gave a 100\% reproducible list of entries whenever repeated.Availability: PowerCore software uses the .NET Framework Version 1.1 environment which is freely available for the MS Windows platform. The files can be downloaded from http://genebank.rda.go.kr/powercore/. The distribution of the package includes executable programs, sample data and a user manual.Contact: yjpark@rda.go.kr},

  ABSTRACT = {Correlation and covariance matrices provide the basis for all classical multivariate techniques. Many statistical tools exist for analyzing their structure but, surprisingly, there are few techniques for exploratory visual display, and for depicting the patterns of relations among variables in such matrices directly, particularly when the number of variables is moderately large. This article describes a set of techniques we subsume under the name “corrgram,” based on two main schemes: (a) Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude. We consider some of the properties of several iconic representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b) Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that "similar" variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for conditional independence and partial independence is described and illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {With more than 6000 accessions collected from across China, the Chinese National Crop Gene Bank (CNCGB) holds the largest collection of annual wild soybean (Glycine Soja) germplasm in the world. To facilitate the management and utilization of these germplasm collections, it is important to establish a Core Collection. This study compares five sampling strategies, namely random, constant, proportional, logarithmic and genetic diversity-based, to establish a Core Collection for the annual wild soybean germplasm. Among the strategies evaluated, the genetic diversity-based was found to be the simplest and most efficient. Using hierarchical classification and cluster analysis, in the genetic diversity diversity-based strategy, 652 accessions, accounting for 10.65\% of the total 6172 accessions, were selected out to represent the total accessions. The established Core Collection has the following features: (i) the 21 descriptors observed in the entire collection were compared by the Core Collection, all 18 quality characters of entire collection were preserved by core collection, and coincidence rate of average was 98.4\%; (ii) the variant of 13 descriptors of the two collections was very similar, with the coincidence index being 0.96; (iii) the coincidence rate of genetic diversity between the two collections was 81.38\% DNA alleles; (iv) the geographic distribution pattern of core collection was the same as the entire collection; (v) molecular marker analysis by 20 SSR primer pairs on 299 accessions showed that the Core Collection covered 83.64\% of the entire collection. It thus is concluded that the established Core Collection is representative and will be a valuable entry point for better evaluation and more efficient utilization of the genetic resources available in the annual wild soybean germplasm bank.},

  ABSTRACT = {Definition of clear criteria for evaluation of the quality of core collections is a prerequisite for selecting high-quality cores. However, a critical examination of the different methods used in literature, for evaluating the quality of core collections, shows that there are no clear guidelines on the choices of quality evaluation criteria and as a result, inappropriate analyses are sometimes made leading to false conclusions being drawn regarding the quality of core collections and the methods to select such core collections. The choice of criteria for evaluating core collections appears to be based mainly on the fact that those criteria have been used in earlier publications rather than on the actual objectives of the core collection. In this study, we provide insight into different criteria used for evaluating core collections. We also discussed different types of core collections and related each type of core collection to their respective evaluation criteria. Two new criteria based on genetic distance are introduced. The consequences of the different evaluation criteria are illustrated using simulated and experimental data. We strongly recommend the use of the distance-based criteria since they not only allow the simultaneous evaluation of all variables describing the accessions, but they also provide intuitive and interpretable criteria, as compared with the univariate criteria generally used for the evaluation of core collections. Our findings will provide genebank curators and researchers with possibilities to make informed choices when creating, comparing and using core collections.},

Sampling scheme was studied at three levels,i.e., grouping principle, sampling proportion within group andsampling method from each group. Grouping principles used wereDingying's taxonomic system, Cheng-Wang taxonomic system,Yunnan rice ecological zone, Yunnan administrative district, singlecharacter and completely random sampling without grouping. Samplingproportions in each of the groups were square root, logarithm, indexof genetic diversity and fixed proportion. Clustered and randomsampling were carried out in each group. Five parameters, (indexof genetic diversity, variance of phenotypic value, variance ofphenotypic frequency, coefficient of variation and ratio ofphenotypic retained), in primary core collection were used toevaluate the validity of sampling scheme. The better samplingstrategies were grouping principles based on the two taxonomicsystems, decisions on sampling proportion in each group based onsquare root or logarithm, sampling method within group clustered.16\%, 10\% and 5\% overall sampling ratio were usedto establish primary core collections. The results showed that a5∽10\% sampling ratio was suitable for a largecollection.},

  ABSTRACT = {A genetic model with genotype×environment (GE) interactions for controlling systematical errors in the field can be used for predicting genotypic values by an adjusted unbiased prediction (AUP) method. Mahalanobis distance, calculated based on the genotypic values, is then applied to measure the genetic distance among accessions. The unweighted pair-group average, Ward’s and the complete linkage methods of hierarchical clustering combined with three sampling strategies are proposed to construct core collections in a procedure of stepwise clustering. A homogeneous test and t-tests are suggested for use in testing variances and means, respectively. The coincidence rate (CR\%) for range and the variable rate (VR\%) for the coefficient of variation are designed to evaluate the property of core collections. A worked example of constructing core collections in cotton with 21 traits was conducted. Random sampling can represent the genetic diversity structure of the initial collection. Preferred sampling can keep the accessions with special or valuable characteristics in the initial collection. Deviation sampling can retain the larger genetic variability of the initial collection. For better representation of the core collection, cluster methods should be combined with different sampling strategies. The core collections based on genotypic values retained larger genetic variability and had superior representatives than those based on phenotypic values.},

  ABSTRACT = {The principal aims of a core collection are: 1) to include the maximum of diversity of the base collection in a sample of minimum size; and 2) to avoid redundancies. We present here a new method (the Principal Component Scoring) which fulfills these aims. The use of P.C.S. has consequences for sampling stratification and choice of sample size. P.C.S. requires quantitative data, but with small changes can be used for qualitative data.},

  ABSTRACT = {A core collection is a subset of a large germplasm collection that contains accessions chosen to represent the genetic variability of the germplasm collection. The purpose of the core collection is to improve management and use of a germplasm collection. Core collections are usually assembled by grouping accessions and selecting from within these groups. The objective of this study was to compare 11 methods of assembling a core collection of the U.S. National collection of annual Medicago species. These methods differed in their use of passport and evaluation data as well as their selection strategy. Another objective was to compare core collections with sample sizes of 5\%, 10\% and 17\% of the germplasm collection. Core collections assembled with evaluation data and cluster analysis better represented the germplasm collection than core collections assembled based solely on passport data and random selection of accessions, The Relative Diversity and the logarithm methods generated better core collections than the proportional method. The 5\% and 10\% sample size core collection were judged insufficient to represent the germplasm collection.},

The matrix of similarities between all pairs of sample units is shown to be positive semidefinite (except possibly when there are missing values). This is important for the multidimensional Euclidean representation of the sample and also establishes some inequalities amongst the similarities relating three individuals. The definition is extended to cope with a hierarchy of characters.},
