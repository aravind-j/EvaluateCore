\usage{
coverage.evaluate.core(data, names, qualitative, selected, na.omit = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame object. The data frame should possess
one row per individual and columns with the individual names and multiple
trait/character data.}

\item{names}{Name of column with the individual names as a character string.}

\item{qualitative}{Name of columns with the qualitative traits as a character
vector.}

\item{selected}{Character vector with the names of individuals selected in
core collection and present in the \code{names} column.}

\item{na.omit}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, missing values (\code{NA}) are
ignored and not included as a distinct factor level for analysis. Default
is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The Class Coverage value.
}
\description{
Compute the Class Coverage \insertCite{kim_PowerCore_2007}{EvaluateCore} to
compare the distribution frequencies of qualitative traits between entire
collection (EC) and core set (CS). \loadmathjax
}
\details{
Class Coverage \insertCite{kim_PowerCore_2007}{EvaluateCore} is computed as
follows.

\mjsdeqn{Class\, Coverage = \left ( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}
\frac{k_{CS_{i}}}{k_{EC_{i}}} \right ) \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{k_{CS_{i}}} is the number of phenotypic classes in CS for the
\mjseqn{i}th trait, \mjseqn{k_{EC_{i}}} is the number of phenotypic classes
in EC for the \mjseqn{i}th trait and \mjseqn{n} is the total number of
traits.
