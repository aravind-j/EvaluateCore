\details{
The differences are computed as follows.

\mjtdeqn{MD\\\%_{Hu} = \left ( \frac{S_{t}}{n} \right ) \times
100}{MD\\\\\\\%_{Hu} = \left ( \frac{S_{t}}{n} \right ) \times 100}{MD\%_{Hu}
= \left ( \frac{S_{t}}{n} \right ) \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{S_{t}} is the number of traits with a significant difference
between the means of the EC and the CS and \mjseqn{n} is the total number of
traits. A representative core should have
\mjteqn{MD\\\%_{Hu}}{MD\\\\\\\%_{Hu}}{MD\%_{Hu}} < 20 \% and \mjseqn{CR} > 80
\% \insertCite{hu_methods_2000}{EvaluateCore}.

\mjtdeqn{VD\\\%_{Hu} = \left ( \frac{S_{F}}{n} \right ) \times
100}{VD\\\\\\\%_{Hu} = \left ( \frac{S_{F}}{n} \right ) \times 100}{VD\%_{Hu}
= \left ( \frac{S_{F}}{n} \right ) \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{S_{F}} is the number of traits with a significant difference
between the variances of the EC and the CS and \mjseqn{n} is the total number
of traits. Larger \mjteqn{VD\\\%_{Hu}}{VD\\\\\\\%_{Hu}}{VD\%_{Hu}} value
indicates a more diverse core set.

\mjtdeqn{MD\\\%_{Kim} = \left ( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left |
M_{EC_{i}}-M_{CS_{i}} \right |}{M_{CS_{i}}} \right ) \times
100}{MD\\\\\\\%_{Kim} = \left ( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left |
M_{EC_{i}}-M_{CS_{i}} \right |}{M_{CS_{i}}} \right ) \times 100}{MD\%_{Kim} =
\left ( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left | M_{EC_{i}}-M_{CS_{i}} \right
|}{M_{CS_{i}}} \right ) \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{M_{EC_{i}}} is the mean of the EC for the \mjseqn{i}th trait,
\mjseqn{M_{CS_{i}}} is the mean of the CS for the \mjseqn{i}th trait and
\mjseqn{n} is the total number of traits.

\mjtdeqn{VD\\\%_{Kim} = \left ( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left |
V_{EC_{i}}-V_{CS_{i}} \right |}{V_{CS_{i}}} \right ) \times
100}{VD\\\\\\\%_{Kim} = \left ( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left |
V_{EC_{i}}-V_{CS_{i}} \right |}{V_{CS_{i}}} \right ) \times 100}{VD\%_{Kim} =
\left ( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left | V_{EC_{i}}-V_{CS_{i}} \right
|}{V_{CS_{i}}} \right ) \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{V_{EC_{i}}} is the variance of the EC for the \mjseqn{i}th
trait, \mjseqn{V_{CS_{i}}} is the variance of the CS for the \mjseqn{i}th
trait and \mjseqn{n} is the total number of traits.

\mjtdeqn{\overline{d}D\\\% =
\frac{\overline{d}_{CS}-\overline{d}_{EC}}{\overline{d}_{EC}} \times
100}{\overline{d}D\\\\\\\% =
\frac{\overline{d}_{CS}-\overline{d}_{EC}}{\overline{d}_{EC}} \times
100}{\overline{d}D\\% =
\frac{\overline{d}_{CS}-\overline{d}_{EC}}{\overline{d}_{EC}} \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{\overline{d}_{CS}} is the mean squared Euclidean distance
among accessions in the CS and \mjseqn{\overline{d}_{EC}} is the mean squared
Euclidean distance among accessions in the EC.

Percentage of range ratios smaller than 0.70
\insertCite{diwan_methods_1995}{EvaluateCore} is computed as follows.

\mjtdeqn{RR\\\%_{0.7} = \left ( \frac{S_{RR_{0.7}}}{n} \right ) \times
100}{RR\\\\\\\%_{0.7} = \left ( \frac{S_{RR_{0.7}}}{n} \right ) \times
100}{RR\%_{0.7} = \left ( \frac{S_{RR_{0.7}}}{n} \right ) \times 100}

Where, \mjseqn{S_{RR_{0.7}}} is the number of traits with a range ratio
smaller than 0.7 (\mjseqn{\frac{R_{CS_{i}}}{R_{EC_{i}}} < 0.7})
\mjseqn{R_{CS_{i}}} is the range of the \mjseqn{i}th trait in the CS,
\mjseqn{R_{EC_{i}}} is the range of the \mjseqn{i}th trait in the EC and
\mjseqn{n} is the total number of traits.
