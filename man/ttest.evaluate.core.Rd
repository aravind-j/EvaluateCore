\usage{
ttest.evaluate.core(data, names, quantitative, selected)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data as a data frame object. The data frame should possess
one row per individual and columns with the individual names and multiple
trait/character data.}

\item{names}{Name of column with the individual names as a character string.}

\item{quantitative}{Name of columns with the quantitative traits as a
character vector.}

\item{selected}{Character vector with the names of individuals selected in
core collection and present in the \code{names} column.}
}
\value{
\item{Trait}{The quantitative trait.} \item{Count}{The accession
  count (excluding missing data).} \item{Df}{The degrees of freedom for the
  test.} \item{EC_Min}{The minimum value of the trait in EC.}
  \item{EC_Max}{The maximum value of the trait in EC.}
  \item{EC_Mean}{The mean value of the trait in EC.} \item{EC_SE}{The
  standard error of the trait in EC.} \item{CS_Min}{The minimum value of the
  trait in CS.} \item{CS_Max}{The maximum value of the trait in CS.}
  \item{CS_Mean}{The mean value of the trait in CS.} \item{CS_SE}{The
  standard error of the trait in CS.} \item{ttest_pvalue}{The p value of the
  Student's t test for equality of means of EC and CS.}
  \item{ttest_significance}{The significance of the Student's t test for
  equality of means of EC and CS.}
}
\description{
Test difference between means of entire collection (EC) and core set (CS) for
quantitative traits by Student's t test (in particular it's adaptation for
comparison of groups with unequal variances known as Welch's two sample
t-test)
